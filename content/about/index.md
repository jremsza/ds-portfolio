## Data Scientist | Data Engineer | Ex-Chemist

I am a Data Scientist and Engineer combining a decade of scientific rigor with modern big data architectures. With a background as a Chemist, I spent ten years mastering the lifecycle of experimental data—from hypothesis generation to statistical analysis and stakeholder presentation. I have since pivoted this analytical foundation into the digital realm, recently completing my M.S. in Data Science at Northwestern University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

Currently, I work as a Data Specialist at MilliporeSigma, where I leverage tools like PySpark and Palantir Foundry to manage large-scale product data portfolios. My work focuses on building efficient data pipelines and visualizations that improve operational effectiveness and enhance customer experiences for millions of users.

My Approach My transition from the laboratory to data science is defined by one core belief: Data is the new experimental frontier. Whether optimizing chemical formulations or e-commerce algorithms, the principles of integrity, reproducibility, and rigorous testing remain the same. I am now seeking to apply my skills in Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and NLP to solve complex, high-impact business problems.

Technical Toolkit: Python, SQL, R, Go, PySpark, Palantir Foundry, TensorFlow, Git/GitHub.

Based in Milwaukee, WI.
