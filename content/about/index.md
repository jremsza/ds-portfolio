## Data Scientist | Engineer | Ex-Chemist

With a background as a Chemist, I spent ten years mastering the lifecycle of experimental data—from hypothesis generation to statistical analysis and stakeholder presentations. I have since pivoted this analytical foundation into the digital realm, recently completing my M.S. in Data Science from Northwestern University with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence.

Current Work Currently, I work as an Analytics Engineer at MilliporeSigma. I leverage tools like PySpark and Palantir Foundry to manage large-scale data portfolios serving millions of users. My work focuses on building efficient data pipelines and visualizations that improve operational effectiveness and drive data-driven business decisions.

My Approach I believe data is the new experimental frontier. Whether optimizing chemical formulations or e-commerce algorithms, the principles of integrity, reproducibility, and rigorous testing remain the same. I translate clinical-level rigor into the digital space, engineering systems that make data trustworthy, scalable, and actionable. I specialize in applying Machine Learning, Data Engineering, and NLP to solve complex, high-impact business problems.

Technical Toolkit: Python, SQL, R, Go, PySpark, Palantir Foundry, TensorFlow/PyTorch, Git/GitHub.

Based in Milwaukee, WI.
