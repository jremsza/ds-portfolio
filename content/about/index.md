## Who am I?

With a decade of experience in various laboratory roles, I've honed a robust analytical skillset, specializing in analyzing complex data, interpreting experimental results, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Alongside my proficiency in problem-solving and troubleshooting in day-to-day projects, I take pride in my adaptability to change—a trait that has been pivotal in navigating dynamic work environments. As a lifelong learner, I embrace new challenges and stay at the forefront of evolving technologies and methodologies, ensuring continued growth and success in my endeavors. Fueled by a passion for science, technology, and data, I've embarked on a journey to change careers, pursuing a master's degree in data science at Northwestern University. My ultimate goal is to pivot my career, and immerse myself in the dynamic realm of data science, aspiring to be a proficient data science or data engineer, and my work as a chemist has postioned me perfectly for this transition. I reside in Milwaukee, WI where I currently work for MilliporeSigma on the Digital and ecommerce team as a product data specialist for the last year.

## My Experience

In my role as a chemist, I played a pivotal role in numerous projects supporting the manufacting, R&D and quality control teams. I actively contributed to the entire data lifecycle that encompassed everything from the inception and planning of experiments to data collection, processing, analysis—often involving statistical methods—and the presentation of results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. In my current role as a data professional, I work on complex projects in managing and optimizing large-scale product data portfolios. I specialize in leveraging tools like PySpark and Palantir Foundry to build efficient data visualizations and data pipelines to support strategic data initiatives. My expertise in data governance, product information management (PIM), and data strategy development has enabled me to enhance customer experiences, improve operational effectiveness, and deliver on key organizational goals. By collaborating with cross-functional teams, I’ve ensured data integrity across platforms, supporting millions of users and orders annually.

Throughout my master's program at Northwestern University, I immersed myself in challenging yet rewarding courses, including Math for Data Scientists, Statistics with R, Database Systems, Machine Learning, Decision Analytics, Data Engineering with Go, and Artificial Intelligence and Deep Learning. These courses have not only deepened my proficiency in mathematics and statistics but have also expanded my programming skills in Python, SQL, R, and Go. I am adept at using CLI tools and leveraging Git and GitHub throughout the project lifecycle. My specialization in data engineering during my master's degree aligns with my passion for this field
