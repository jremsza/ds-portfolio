## Who am I?

With a decade of diverse experience in various laboratory roles, I've honed a robust analytical skillset, specializing in analyzing complex data, interpreting experimental results, and drawing meaningful conclusions. Alongside my proficiency in problem-solving and troubleshooting in day-to-day projects, I take pride in my adaptability to change—a trait that has been pivotal in navigating dynamic work environments. As a lifelong learner, I embrace new challenges and stay at the forefront of evolving technologies and methodologies, ensuring continued growth and success in my endeavors. Fueled by a passion for science, technology, and data, I've embarked on a journey to change careers, pursuing a master's degree in data science at Northwestern University. My ultimate goal is to pivot my career out of the lab, and immerse myself in the dynamic realm of data, aspiring to be a proficient data engineer or data scientist, and my work as a chemist has postioned me perfectly for this transition. I reside in Milwaukee, WI where I currently work for MilliporeSigma and have worked on the analytical development team for the last 4 years.

## My Experience

In my role as a chemist, I played a pivotal role in numerous projects supporting the manufacting, R&D and quality control teams. I actively contributed to the entire data lifecycle that encompassed everything from the inception and planning of experiments to data collection, processing, analysis—often involving statistical methods—and the presentation of results to both technical and non-technical stakeholders. I am an expert at leveraging cutting-edge scientific instrumentation and software to efficiently gather and integrate data from diverse projects and cross-functional teams. Extending my skill set beyond the laboratory, I have applied my expertise to the technology domain, leading digital technology advancements within my workgroup. These advancements include creating a SharePoint website to bundle data and information into a central hub as well as leaveraging PowerBI to track metrics. I've had the opportunity to learn and utilize Palantir Foundry analytics software through company-provided training courses on the Palantir Foundry platform.

Throughout my master's program at Northwestern University, I immersed myself in challenging yet rewarding courses, including 'Math for Data Scientists,' 'Statistics with R,' 'Database Systems,' 'Machine Learning,' and 'Decision Analytics.' These courses have not only deepened my proficiency in mathematics and statistics but have also expanded my programming skills in Python, SQL, and R. I am adept at using CLI tools and leveraging git and GitHub throughout the project lifecycle. My specialization focus in data engineering during my master's degree aligns with my passion for this field.
